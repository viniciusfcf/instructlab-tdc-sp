# Vinícius Ferraz
**Senior Specialist Solution Architect at Red Hat**  
Federal District, Brazil

---

## Summary
I am Vinicius, a 38-year-old Java Developer with a strong software background and 18 years of IT experience. I graduated from the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG, Brazil).

I have solid foundations in programming, architecture, and software design. I started programming in 2004. I am a very flexible, self-taught, and responsible person with a good balance of hard and soft skills.

After my personal YouTube channel, my Udemy course, and my current job at Red Hat, I confirmed I have good communication skills.

Right now, I am working as a Specialist Solution Architect for Red Hat, focused on cloud-native application development and our middleware solutions, mainly Quarkus.
